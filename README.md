**Authors: Ruichen Jiang, Nazanin Abolfazli, Aryan Mokhtari and Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani** 

This repository contains the MATLAB code for the numerical experiment in our paper [A Conditional Gradient-based Method for Simple Bilevel Optimization with Convex Lower-level Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08868), which has been accepted by AISTATS 2023.   

## Usage
- **Over-parametrized Regression**: run the script "main_LeastSquare_wiki.m" in the "over_parametrized" folder. It also requires installing CVX (<http://cvxr.com/cvx/>).
- **Fair Classification**: run the script "fair_classification.m" in the "fair_classification" folder. 
- **Dictionary Learning**: run the script "main_dict_learning.m" in the "dict_learning" folder. 
- **Toy Example**: run the script "toy_example.m" in the "Toy example" folder.
